I always had trouble taking my medication and supplements routinely, so I designed and developed an Automated Medication Dispenser. Now, I am motivated to keep my medication streaks going and never have to ask myself whether or not I took my meds that day.
This machine comes with features to store data on the cloud, dispense medication wirelessly via the internet, and track and display data for user feedback.
